# Rainbow-Kids-A-Play-School
Official Website for Rainbow Kids A play School, Bhagaplur, India.

I decided to stick to the basics to design the website. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP. 

JavaScript libraries used:
1. Swiper.min.js
2. Particles.js
3. owl-carousel.min.js

Stylings used:
1. style.css
2. w3.css
3. Bootstrap

Design software used for planning out my website- Adobe XD.

Design concepts that I tried implement:

1. Animated hover translations.
2. Animated background ( pretty basic huh... wait for the next update )
3. Neumorphism designs ( Join Us and Testimonials section )  
4. 3D Coverflow design ( For Gallery Images )
5. Animated Text Headers.

Future Design Ideas:

I am not entirely happy with the mobile experience of the website so I am thinking about keeping the contents static with some elemnts in the background having minimal animations. Parallax scrolling, Scroll Animation ideas, and a window to think about student's portal implementation-these are on the table too.
